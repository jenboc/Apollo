*Music Generation using LSTM Cells.*

This project was completed as my NEA submission for my A-Level Computer Science exam (2023). It required me to do thorough research into machine learning, having only dabbled slightly with Tensorflow before taking on this project. 

This is definitely a project I want to return to in the future, and hopefully improve the bad performance of the AI myself (without having to use any machine learning libraries to help me do this). However, even though the network does not perform very well, it has help me appreciate the complexities of large scale models such as Chat-GPT since machine learning tools is something that I think many people take for granted.
